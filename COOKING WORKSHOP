Hey brus! 

So some of you have shown interest in learning how to do some basic cooking so I'm going to hold a College Cooking Workshop! I'll teach you how to make an easy meal for dinner, but let me know what kinds of things you want to learn whether it be how to fry an egg or make a spaghetti dinner for bae. Fill this form out by tonight so I can get groceries! I plan on holding it Wednesday night during dinner, at about 5:30pm. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
LUNCH
Meat: sliced chicken breast (check price for pork)
Carb: whole grain wraps/crackers
Veggie: fresh veggies (bell peppers and hummus)
Fruit: grapes 
Dairy: + yogurt and honey
----------------------------------------------------------------------

During the school year especially in the fall I had to balance schoolwork + job + marching band + eating healthy 

A technique that alleviated this was Prepping my meals 

Prepping your meals: make bigger portions on Sundays, and then divide those portions for lunches during the week; 
Tupperware + Ziploc bags are your friend

Tips for making a quick, healthy lunch:

The goal is to get all the major food groups on your plate:

Protein: Pork (leaner meats are always encouraged; chicken, eggs)
Carbs: whole grains bread, wraps, brown rice (minute made rice)
Veggie: [bell peppers, cucumbers, carrots] + hummus are the best
Fruit: strawberries, grapes, melon 
Dairy: Yogurt + honey, cheese on your wraps or with your veg

DINNER (I think dinner can be even easier for some, less ingredients)

Meat
Carb
Veggie

(But if you want, throw in some raw fruits + veggies)
