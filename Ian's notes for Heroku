Creating a new rails app with postgresql instead of sqlite3

run:

$ rails new appname -d postgresql

once it's done run:

$ rake db:create

this is a command that gets run by default with sqlite3, but we have to run it manually wihen using postgresql

now git init, add all, and commit

once you've done that run:

$ heroku create appname

where appname must be unique, so you might have to try a few before you find one that hasn't been used before

then check your remote to see if it's properly in your git

$ git remote -v

you should see two entries, one for fetch and one for push, we will use push

run:

$ git push heroku master

once this is done you'll see some WARNINGS, one asks you to add rails_12factor gem to your gem file, do this and bundle, while you're in there set your ruby version. To check your ruby version run:

$ ruby -v

You'll get something like this:

ruby 2.2.1p85 ...

this means you are using ruby 2.2.1 so in your Gem file at the top type in:

ruby '2.2.1'

save and bundle then run git push heroku master again and once that is done run:

$ heroku run rake db:migrate

once that finishes run:

$ heroku open

this will open your heroku hosted website in the browser, it should work fine
